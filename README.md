In this project, I began by considering the goals and requirements, breaking down functionality into manageable parts. Working on the 3D scene helped me strengthen my ability to visualize and plan environments while balancing technicality and aesthetics. 
I followed an iterative process, layering on textures, lighting, and camera controls step by step, testing and refining along the way. I used new development strategies like creating reusable functions and fine-tuning visual elements in small increments. Over time, my approach evolved from simply making things work to reorganizing and cleaning up code for clarity and reusability. 
This experience has shown me how computer science equips me with tools for creative problem-solving and building complex projects. The skills Iâ€™ve gained in computational graphics and visualization will help me in future studies and professional roles, particularly those involving graphics programming, simulation, or technical software development.
